1. 
The "while" construct checks the condition at the beginning of each iteration, 
and the "do/while" construct checks the condition at the end of each iteration. 
That "do/while" construct ensures the loop runs at least once, and it is very useful 
for user input when at least one attempt to get.


2. 
In the given code example:
```
if (mode == 'D' || mode == 'W' || mode == 'F')
{
  ...
}
else if (mode == 'Q')
{
  ...
}
```
The "if/else if" can prevent unnecessary evaluation of subsequent conditions once 
a true condition is found. In comparison, a series of "if" optional path constructs 
evaluates all conditions.

3.
To make my code organized and easy to read, I emphasized consistency in using constructs 
for similar tasks. Additionally, I placed comments before blocks of code to explain 
their purpose, and I chose meaningful variable names to make the code self-documenting.
