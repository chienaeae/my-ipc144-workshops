Instruc7ons 
Record your answer(s) to the reflec7on ques7on(s) in the provided “reflect.txt” text file 
1. Execute the following code on your machine and record the result. 
   
   int a = 3;
   a++;
   printf("a = %d”,a);

Then execute this code and record the result 
   
   int a = 3;
   printf("a = %d”,a++);
   
  Compare the recorded results; what is the value of variable ‘a’ a;er the print func7on in each code snippet? 
Explain the difference between the two of them and why they generated two different outputs.  


2. Given the following C statements: 

    float price1 = 24.96f, price3 = 24.97;
    double price2 = 24.96, price4 = 24.97;  
    printf("1. 24.96 = %f (as cents:%d)\n", price1, (int)(price1 * 100));
    printf("2. 24.97 = %lf (as cents:%d)\n", price2, (int)(price2 * 100));
    printf("3. 24.96 = %f (as cents:%d)\n", price3, (int)(price3 * 100));
    printf("4. 24.97 = %lf (as cents:%d)\n", price4, (int)(price4 * 100));

Execute the above sample code on your machine.  Briefly explain why price1 and the corresponding converted 
cent value do not properly represent the intended value.  Why do you think all the other samples work as 
expected? 

3. Execute the below code on your machine: 

    int result, money = 2031;
    printf("1. $%.2lf\n", money / 100);
    printf("2. $%d\n", money / 100);
    printf("3. $%.2lf\n", (double)money / 100);
    printf("4. $%d\n", (double)money / 100);
    
Explain why these three examples work as intended. Apply terms like cast, promoJon, coercion, implicit, and 
explicit in your answer.
