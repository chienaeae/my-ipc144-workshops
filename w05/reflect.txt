1. The `for` iteration still can be used to validate rating values from user input
, but it is not the best option for it. The `for` iteration construct is mainly used 
when the number of iterations is known.

2. I used the `switch` construct for printing each specific case of the month, because 
it provides a clear way to handle each case matching literal values compared to conditional 
expressions.

3. There are several advantages of using macros to define constant variables:
    a. Centralizeing the definition enhances the readability and maintenance
    b. Ensureing the scope of the life across whole program
    c. Serving as a clearly referenced configuration for the program
